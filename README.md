# Keyword-extraction
Information Retrieval - Keyword Extraction Project

#Goal of the project
Introduce the use of k-means clustering, SVD and TextRake (RAKE weight + TextRank reweight) for the keyword extraction task

#Requirement
Make surey you have the proper nltk package installed (for example, we used punkt for tokenizing, stemmers, lemmatizers etc...)

#Evaluation
Using the SemEval2010 dataset test part (92 documents). RAKE implemetation we benchmarked against can be found at https://github.com/zelandiya/RAKE-tutorial

#TODO
Improve keyphrase building by using Jaccard coefficient to remove keywords that are similar to others.
For grading purpose, we're keeping the system as it is and will do further improvement after April 2016

#HowTo
We provided demo.py to toy around with the 3 algorithms. Simply put your text files in a single folder and input in your command line: python demo.py *algo* *folder_link* *type*; where algo is either svd, raketr or cluster, and type is either "single" or "phrases"

For evaluation on dataset: please refer to evaluate_*.py to see how it works. In general, simply run evaluate_single.py (with one command line argument specifying the method to use, which can be: 'svd' or 'raketr' or 'cluster'; the same applies to keyphrases extraction) to evaluate single keyword extraction and evaluate_multiple.py for keyphrases extraction.

python evaluate_{single, multiple}.py {svd, raketr, cluster}

Also we provided a simple web program in Flask to toy with!

#Note
Running "evaluate_*.py cluster" may not yield the exact same values in our report, may be off by 1% due to convergence.
